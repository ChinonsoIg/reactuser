This app is built with React. I used function components and react hooks.
The styling was done with Bootstrap CDN.

The app fetches users data from https://randomuser.me/api/.
When you click on All users, the app updates and displays both male and female users. When you click on male users, it updates and fetches only male users. Similarly, when you click on female users, it fetches and displays only female users.

the app is also paginated. You can click on the pages to get the rest of the users fetched, as only three users are displayed per page.
